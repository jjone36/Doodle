: *Image Classification with 50 animal drawings from Quick Draw game data at Google*

## ***1. What is Quick Draw?***
‚ÄúQuick, Draw!‚Äù is a game created by Google. It's a game where one player is prompted to draw a picture of an object, and the other player needs to guess what it is. More details can be found [this post](https://towardsdatascience.com/quick-draw-the-worlds-largest-doodle-dataset-823c22ffce6b)

This project is for building an image classifier model that can handle noisy and sometimes incomplete drawings and perform well on classifying 50 different animals. Starting from a simple CNN as a baseline, I used Residual Net and VGG16. The final score was ~~ of the accuracy.
