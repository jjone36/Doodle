# Quick Draw: Catch doodle! üê∂üêºüê∑
: *Image Classification with 50 animal drawings from Quick Draw game data at Google*

## ***1. What is Quick Draw?***
"Quick, Draw!" was released as an experimental game to educate the public in a playful way about how AI works. The game prompts users to draw an image depicting a certain category, such as ‚Äùbanana,‚Äù ‚Äútable,‚Äù etc. The game generated more than 1B drawings, of which a subset was publicly released as the basis for this competition‚Äôs training set. That subset contains 50M drawings encompassing 340 label categories. More details can be found [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/quick-draw-the-worlds-largest-doodle-dataset-823c22ffce6b).

This project is for building an image classifier model that can handle noisy and sometimes incomplete drawings and perform well on classifying 50 different animals. Starting from a simple CNN as a baseline, I used Residual Net and VGG19. I choose these models because they are covered in Andrew Ng's DL specialization course On Coursera. I wanted to have a time to practice what I learnt in class. The final score was ~~ of the accuracy.
